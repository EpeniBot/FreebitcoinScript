  You do not lose anything, I just get a little bonus, for having referred you :)
  I will start 10% payouts every friday if you guys are active enough

The instructions are way below.

FAQ:  

* Why are there two scripts? 

  Because the first one is based on the original, the second (script 2) does a slightly different approach. It restarts itself to prevent losing large amounts of money and stops when you have enough to payout. And also the script 2 prevents accidental parralel processing, by stopping such processes on the go. *
    
* How much money is recommended? 
    
   To be sure your bot will earn any cash, you need around 0.00003000 BTC, as the stake doubles for every lose, it may happen, that you would lose everything so be carefull! 
    
* Where did you get the idea from? 

   I got this Idea from https://crd.ht/2N7QJYt , but I don't really know if this is the real source, as I found more people claiming it was theirs. 
   
* Who is this code good for?

   This script was really messy, I remade it completely, for people who just want to learn Javascript and need a fun example.
   It is NOT for guaranteed earning of quick money, freebitco.in is a gambling site, where you just do not have to deposit cash, that's why you are earning something, but not much and with lots of luck

 Collect at least 3000 Satoshi (0.00003000 BTC) before you start, or the risk of losing is too high!
 
 * To run this bot, open up your Google Chrome Console by pressing "Ctrl+Shift+J"
 * On Firefox Press F12 and navigate to the console.
 * copy and paste one of the scripts into the console and hit Enter.
 * Now a new button appears on top of the website, called configure Bot, click it.
 * If you don't know what to click next, just click on OK until the bot starts :)
 * Let this Bot run for a while, once it catches on a "trend" it will keep earning
 *
 *  If you want the bot to collect alot of cash, you have to invest alot of cash.
 *  It will not make you a fortune, but at least, when you have some luck, it will reach the amound of BTC you can payout to your wallet.
