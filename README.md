# FreebitcoinScript
This script is to play around with the Multiplier in Freebitco.in

FAQ:
    * Why are there two scripts?
      Because the first one is based on the original, the second (script 2) does a slightly different approach.
      It restarts itself to prevent losing large amounts of money and stops when you have enough to payout.
      And also the script 2 prevents accidental parralel processing, by stopping such processes on the go.
    * How much money is recommended?
      To be sure your bot will earn any cash, you need around 0.00003000 BTC, as the stake doubles for every lose, it may happen, that you would lose everything so be carefull!
    * How did you get the idea?
         I got this Idea from https://crd.ht/2N7QJYt , but I don't really know if this is the real source, as I found more people claiming it was theirs

 * To run this bot, open up your Google Chrome Console by pressing "Ctrl+Shift+J"
 *
 * Let this Bot run for a while, once it catches on a "trend" it will keep earning
 *
 *  If you want the bot to collect alot of cash, you have to invest alot of cash.
 *  It will not make you a fortune, but at least, when you have some luck, it will reach the amound of BTC you can payout to your wallet.
